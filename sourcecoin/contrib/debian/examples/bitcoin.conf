# Network-related settings:

# Run on the test network instead of the real CM_LowercaseCoinName network.
#testnet=1

# Connect via a socks4 proxy

# Use as many addnode= settings as you like to connect to specific peers

# JSON-RPC options (for controlling a running CM_UppercaseCoinName/CM_LowercaseCoinNamed process)

# server=1 tells CM_UppercaseCoinName to accept JSON-RPC commands.
#server=1

# You must set rpcuser and rpcpassword to secure the JSON-RPC api
#rpcuser=Ulysseys
#rpcpassword=YourSuperGreatPasswordNumber_385593

# By default, only RPC connections from localhost are allowed.  Specify

# You can use CM_UppercaseCoinName or CM_LowercaseCoinNamed to send commands to CM_UppercaseCoinName/CM_LowercaseCoinNamed
# running on another host using this option:

# Set gen=1 to attempt to generate CM_LowercaseCoinNames

# Pre-generate this many public/private key pairs, so wallet backups will be valid for
# both prior transactions and several dozen future transactions.

# Pay an optional transaction fee every time you send CM_LowercaseCoinNames.  Transactions with fees
